# spotify-country-song-pop


In this academic project, my team was tasked with exploring a causal relationship in a business case. We need to come up with a model that would predict the effects of changing a feature in our proposed business. We chose to focus on music performance on spotify and explored the causal relationship between song length and specifically country song performance.
